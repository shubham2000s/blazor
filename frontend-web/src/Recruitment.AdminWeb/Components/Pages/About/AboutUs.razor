                        Shokai was created to close the gap between how companies actually hire and how great talent really moves – through trusted referrals. We bring Hirers, Referrers and Networkers together on a single global platform so every opportunity can travel through real relationships.

                    <p class="company-description">
                        Instead of cold applications and noisy job boards, you get warm introductions from people who understand both the role and the candidate. The result is faster hiring, better matches and stronger, longer lasting teams.
